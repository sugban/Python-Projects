## Quantium Virtual Internship - Task 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Final presentation on the basis of the analysis report for client and country manager
I have visualized the performance of overall stores along with trial vs control stores with the recommendation based on the insight. For that I focused on-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Overall sales through year 2018-19 of the stores 
* Selected control stores most correlated with trial stores
* Checking each trial store individually in comparison with the control store to get a clear view of its overall performance by breaking down them into -
      - total sales revenue
      - total number of customers
      - average number of transactions per customer

* Last but not least collate findings to provide recommendation
