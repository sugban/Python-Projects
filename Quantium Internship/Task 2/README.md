## Quantium Virtual Internship - Task 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Experimentation and uplift testing
I have examined the performance in trial vs control stores for the recommendation for each location based on the insight. For that I focused on-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Selecting control stores most correlated with trial stores
* Checking each trial store individually in comparison with the control store to get a clear view of its overall performance by breaking down them into -
      - total sales revenue
      - total number of customers
      - average number of transactions per customer

* Last but not least collate findings to provide recommendation
